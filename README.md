<br><br>AS A traveler
<br>I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
<br>SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
<br>
<br>GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
<br>WHEN I search for a city
<br>THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
<br>WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
<br>THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
<br>WHEN I view the UV index
<br>THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
<br>WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
<br>THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
<br>WHEN I click on a city in the search history
